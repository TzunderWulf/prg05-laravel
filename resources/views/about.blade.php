                        Genshin Impact is a free-to-play action RPG developed and published by miHoYo. The game
                        features a fantasy open-world environment and action based combat system using elemental
                        magic, character switching, and gacha monetization system for players to obtain new characters,
                        weapons, and other resources. The game can only be played with an internet connection and
                        features a limited multiplayer mode allowing up to four players in a world.

                    <p>
                        Players can explore the game's large fantasy world, called Teyvat, with over 35+ characters
                        and various points of interest spread across the map. The game features an action combat
                        playstyle that allows the player to swap between 4 individual characters in a party to quickly
                        combo attacks. Single-player gameplay is the focus of the game, with Co-Op Mode available for
                        certain activities.

                        Each character has two unique combat skills: an Elemental Skill and an Elemental Burst. The
                        elemental skill can be used at any time except for the cooldown period immediately after use,
                        while the elemental burst has an energy cost, requiring the user to amass sufficient energy
                        first.

                        Characters have control over one of seven natural elements: Cryo, Dendro, Pyro, Hydro, Anemo,
                        Electro, and Geo. Cooking is another significant aspect of Genshin Impact's gameplay. Players
                        gather many resources in the course of their adventure, some of which can be turned into dishes
                        via cooking. Some dishes regenerate characters' health, while others boost attack or defensive
                        abilities.
